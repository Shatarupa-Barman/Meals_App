## 🍕 Project Title :-
MEALS APP

## 😀About the Project:-
- The Meals App is a web application that allows food enthusiasts to search for their favourite meals and discover new recipes. 
- This is a single-page website where you can search for any meal.
- Users can search for meals based on keywords, view meal details, and add meals to their favourites list.

## 📌Features :-
- Search for Meals: Users can search for meals by entering keywords in the search bar. The app fetches meal data from the [MealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php) to provide search results.  Enter keywords in the search bar to search for meals. The app will display meal cards matching your search query.

- View Meal Details: Clicking on a meal card displays detailed information about the selected meal, including its name, category, area, instructions, and ingredients. Click on the Watch Video Button and it will move you to the youtube link of the recipe.

- Add to Favorites: Users can add meals to their favourites list by clicking on the heart icon. The selected meals are stored in the browser's local storage for future reference.

- Favorites List: The app maintains a favourites list that allows users to view their saved meals. The favourites list is accessible through a sidebar and can be toggled on and off.
  You can remove a meal from your favourites list by clicking the "Remove" button next to the meal in the sidebar.
